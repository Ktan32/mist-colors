Mist-colors is a pack of themes for gtk2/gtk3 which are simple but cute. 
Inspired by gnome-colors icon themes and original mist gtk theme.
Based on Mist-Redmond: http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=155580

Themes are made for Xfce4 with xfwm (or without window decorator at all) but can be used anywhere.

New versions can be taken from github: https://github.com/Ktan32/mist-colors

WARNING! For gtk2 you'll have to install mist-engine.
